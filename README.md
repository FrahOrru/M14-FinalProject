Scene Setup: The project starts by setting up a Three.js scene with a canvas element for rendering. A directional light is added to illuminate the objects, and shadows are enabled for a more realistic appearance.

Object Materials: The sphere is given a material with a texture map and displacement map to enhance its appearance. The imported group of objects shares the same material properties.

Animation on Scroll: The scroll event listener detects changes in the user's scroll position. As the user scrolls, the rotation of the objects in the scene is dynamically adjusted, creating an animated effect.

Parallax Effect: The parallax effect is achieved by adjusting the camera's position based on the scroll position. This gives the illusion of depth and enhances the 3D experience.

Interactive Particles: A set of particles is generated using random positions. These particles respond to the user's cursor movement and add a dynamic element to the scene.

Raycasting: The scene uses raycasting to detect intersections between the user's cursor and objects. However, the code provided currently doesn't handle any specific behavior when an intersection occurs.

Responsive Design: The project is designed to be responsive by updating the camera's aspect ratio and renderer size when the window is resized. This ensures that the scene maintains its proportions on different devices.

Decision Points
Camera Group: A camera group is used to allow separate movement of the camera and the objects in the scene. This separation enhances the parallax effect and allows for more intricate camera animations.

Animation Approach: The project employs a time-based animation approach using the Clock class from Three.js. This ensures that the animations remain smooth regardless of the user's device performance.
